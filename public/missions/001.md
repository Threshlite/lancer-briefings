## First-Contact
# Background
A mysterious world known as Elysara, is a newly re-discovered planet within the Pact Worlds star system. Once home to a thriving civilization with advanced technology, the planet vanished completely from the face of the Vast. For one hundred years Elysara has been lost; until today. The Starfinder Society believes that Elysara might hold the key to ancient technologies and a once lost civilizations.

# Goals
- Establish diplomatic relations with Elysara.
- Learn about Elysara.
  - Take notes on Elysarian culture, current technology and history.
- Figure out why the planet has reappeared after so long. 

# Stakes
- Elysara once possessed exceedingly advanced technology. It has reappeared on the star charts for the first time in one-hundred years. If we do not venture out now, we run the risk of losing the planet and it's lost technology for good.
